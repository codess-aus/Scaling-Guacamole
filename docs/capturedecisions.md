# How Teams Capture Decision Context in GitHub

1.	Using Issues for Ongoing Context  
Issues aren’t just for bug reports-they serve as living documents where teams discuss and log decisions, technical debates, and clarifying questions.
By keeping conversations and status updates in issues, teams create a searchable, permanent history of choices, priorities, and open questions.
Example: After a stand-up, you could update a feature’s issue with a “Stand-up decisions” section summarizing what was agreed and noting any follow-up actions.

2.	Commenting on Pull Requests  
Decisions from code review can be recorded directly in pull request comments, especially when they pertain to implementation details, trade-offs, or questions that led to final outcomes.
This ensures a direct link between code changes and the rationale behind them, all within GitHub’s context.

3.	Using Discussions for Broader or Open-Ended Conversations  
For more open-ended brainstorming or cross-project thinking, GitHub Discussions provide a forum-style space that’s easy to organize and revisit.
Discussions are great for capturing architectural decisions, recurring debates, or reviewing the outcomes of large cross-team meetings, as threads can stay open indefinitely and be categorized.

4.	Standardization via Issue Templates and Labels  
Many organizations create issue templates that prompt contributors to note "Decision Context" or "Stand-up Notes" explicitly-ensuring important details aren’t forgotten.
Labels like “stand-up-decision” or "action-item" help quickly search/filter what needs follow-up or contains important agreements.

5.	Hierarchy and Task Lists  
Breaking down epics or large issues into sub-issues and using task lists within the issue body keeps the connection from high-level discussion points down to action items.
Task completion and status updates are reflected in real time, adding visibility and accountability.

6.	GitHub Projects for Aggregation  
Adding issues and pull requests to a GitHub Project view (table or board) allows teams to see not just what’s open, but to leave summary notes at the project level-these can include links or decisions relevant to multiple issues.

7.	Summarizing with Copilot  
Copilot chat can help summarize long threads or issues, surfacing the main points and previously made decisions-which is invaluable for onboarding or for anyone catching up after being out-of-the-loop.

## TLDR: 

Promote the use of issues as communication hubs-not just for bugs but for documenting decisions, context, and meeting outcomes.

•	Encourage the use of labels and templates to make critical context discoverable and to standardize how teams record decisions and rationale.  
•	Use project boards and discussions for higher-level alignment and as a place to centralize decisions that span codebases or teams.  
•	Link everything: Reference pull requests, discussions, issues, and even external meeting notes using links so nothing gets orphaned.  
•	Adopt documentation practices in README or CONTRIBUTING.md files to instruct the team on where to log decisions (e.g., “If you made a major architectural choice or deferred work, record it in the relevant issue or discussion thread”).  

Remember - Issues, comments, and discussion threads are all timestamped and searchable. This means you can reconstruct a project’s entire decision and implementation history-a huge advantage for audits, onboarding, or open source contributors wanting deep project context.
