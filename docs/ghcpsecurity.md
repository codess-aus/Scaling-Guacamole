Hero image: GHAS.png

As developers, we all want to build features fast without cutting corners on security. I’ve found GitHub hashtag#Copilot can be a true asset here. When I’m implementing something like user authentication or input validation, Copilot often prompts me to check for edge cases or sanitize inputs as I code.

Sometimes, it even reminds me about potential pitfalls or best practices I might overlook when moving quickly. Of course, the responsibility is still on me to review and test but having GitHub Copilot suggest safer approaches in real time has given my code an extra layer of safety net.

For anyone using hashtag#GitHub Copilot, have you noticed it flagging security issues or nudging you toward more secure code? Share your experiences - would love to learn new ways to leverage Copilot!
