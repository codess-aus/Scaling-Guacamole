Title: The Spec Driven Development Kit
Hero image: SDD2.png

I have to admit, as a developer, working through requirements used to feel like trudging through walls of text. The spec driven development kit has really changed that experience for me. 

Instead of getting lost in piles of documentation, I find myself looking forward to engaging with the specs and seeing my ideas take shape in a much more interactive way.

What I enjoy the most is how this kit breaks things down into clear, manageable specs. It helps me focus on one piece at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by everything at once. The process feels less like a chore and more like a creative challenge. I notice myself making better decisions, and honestly, I have more fun writing code.

I am especially excited about the possibility of bringing this workflow right into VS Code. Being able to manage and edit specs alongside my code would make everything feel so much more natural. No more bouncing between tools or losing my train of thought. I can picture how smooth it would be to refine specs on the fly or update requirements as the code evolves.

Another thing that stands out is comparing and diffing different implementations. Sometimes I try multiple approaches just to see what works best (actually, I often try that - it helps me process my thoughts). Having tools that make it easy to view those differences side by side has opened up a lot of creative experimentation for me. It is way easier to learn from each iteration and pick the option that really fits.

Managing specs and tasks at scale is something I am still figuring out. When a project grows and you end up with dozens of Markdown files, it can get overwhelming fast. I think I would love even more support for organizing and surfacing what matters most, so I stay on track without wasting time searching for the right file.

If anyone else is using spec driven workflows with hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Copilot or has tips for keeping large projects organized, I would love to hear from you. How do you keep your workflow both productive and enjoyable as things scale up?
