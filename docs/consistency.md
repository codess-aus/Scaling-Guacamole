Title: Consistent Code with GitHub Copilot
Hero image: consistency.png

One thing I didn’t expect from GitHub Copilot is how it helps me stay consistent with my coding style - even across different projects. When I pick up a legacy module or switch to a new framework, Copilot is right there suggesting variable names, formatting, and idioms that match the existing code.

But it’s even more useful when tackling those tricky edge cases - error handling, validation scenarios, or tricky conditional logic. Copilot often reminds me to check for things I’d overlook, preventing future headaches in production.

I’m curious: who else relies on Copilot to spot edge cases, or keep their codebase stylistically unified? Any favorite Copilot moments where it saved you tedious clean-up or helped you catch a subtle issue?

(Interesting fact: Copilot reads your workspace history to match your style and can surface fixes for edge cases buried in its vast training data - sometimes even before you anticipate them!)
