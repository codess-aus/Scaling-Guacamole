            <!-- PASTE YOUR CONTENT HERE -->
            
            <p>It seems like everyone is talking about Spec Driven Development - but maybe you are, like me, wondering what it is all about. SDD is an approach where specifications (or "specs") - often written as structured documents, test cases, or code-based contracts - drive the implementation of software features. You begin by creating clear, detailed specs for what a feature, function, or API should do, and then build your code to pass these specs.</p>

            <p>Think of it as building your house from a blueprint, not just going with what feels right each step of the way.</p>

            <h2>The What</h2>
            <p>Specs can be written in plain language, but often take the form of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unit tests (assert my_code(…) == 42)</li>
                <li>API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger docs)</li>
                <li>Formal requirement documents (e.g., Gherkin for BDD)</li>
                <li>JSON/XML schemas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The development team implements features to fulfill these specs. Every change is validated against the spec, ensuring reliability and consistency</p>
            
            <h2>The Why</h2>
            <p>More content...</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduces ambiguity: Everyone knows exactly what’s being built</li>
                <li>Facilitates collaboration: QA, frontend, and backend teams share the same understanding</li>
                <li>Prevents scope creep: The spec is the agreed-upon contract—no surprises</li>
                <li>Automates verification: Specs double as test cases, making regression testing much easier</li>
                <li>Improves agility: You can safely refactor code knowing your specs will catch deviations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The How</h2>
            <p>Typical SDD process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Write a Spec: Define what the functionality should be, often as formal tests or contracts</li>
                <li>Develop to the Spec: Implement code that satisfies the spec</li>
                <li>Validate: Run tests or check the contract to ensure code matches the specification</li>
                <li>Iterate: Refine the spec as needed based on feedback, new requirements, or edge cases</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>When to Use SDD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Building public APIs</li>
                <li>Working across distributed teams</li>
                <li>Developing reusable libraries</li>
                <li>When requirements are likely to change and you want a single “source of truth”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fun fact</h2>
            <p>The NASA space shuttle software was famously spec-driven - every function was verified against huge libraries of specs! Spec driven development helps achieve reliability that’s aerospace-grade.</p>
