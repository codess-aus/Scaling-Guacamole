            <p>I love getting sharp and spot-on code suggestions from GitHub Copilot, and I'm realizing it's no accident. Whenever I put extra thought into context - like writing descriptive comments, using meaningful function and variable names, or keeping my file structure clear—GitHub Copilot seems to really get what I'm aiming for.</p>

            <h2>The Power of Context</h2>
            <p>A few times, I've noticed that just tweaking a comment or renaming a variable helps Copilot improve its next suggestion right away. It's a great reminder that Copilot is more than just predictive typing. It's a partner that gives its best when I'm intentional with my guidance.</p>

            <h2>Key Strategies for Better Suggestions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Comments:</strong> Clear, concise comments tell Copilot exactly what you want the code to do</li>
                <li><strong>Meaningful Names:</strong> Function and variable names that describe their purpose give Copilot better context</li>
                <li><strong>File Structure:</strong> Organizing your code logically helps Copilot understand the architecture</li>
                <li><strong>Type Hints:</strong> Using type annotations provides explicit context about data types and expected inputs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
            <p>What makes this dynamic really interesting is the immediate feedback. When you make these contextual improvements, you often see better suggestions on your next prompt. It's a virtuous cycle where better input leads to better output.</p>

            <h2>Your Experience</h2>
            <p>For anyone else who's been using GitHub Copilot, have you noticed the same? What's your favorite way to give it context or steer its suggestions? Do you have any handy tricks for helping Copilot deliver even better results?</p>
